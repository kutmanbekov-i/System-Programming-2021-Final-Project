For the final project, we modeled the simulation of virus spreading based on the template files with some minor bugs that were fixed further. Our program is so important nowadays in the current world situation. We simulate the virus spreading by changing the colors of the white canvas to some other colors depending on the virus stage. It is not too hard to realize that the white color pixels are the regular person which can change its color as people in real life. The design of our simulation was on Torogeltiev Tilek who decided to draw picture more understandable by choosing the more contrast colors. The problems with the bugs in template files was on Kutmanbekov Isken who was able to figure out why our program doesn’t show the appropriate picture. With the help of Maldybekov Rustem we’ve managed to change some parameters and finally our program got the normal representation, but even in that case with some logical issue our citizens died so fast. And finally Akmatov Emirlan was able to provide the best solution to represent better behavior of ill people.
